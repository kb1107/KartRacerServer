# KartRacerServer
Racing game playable by 2 players on separate workstations

## Set up and running instructions

1.  Navigate to the directory path from a console window:
        ‘~\KartRacerServer\out\production\KartRacerServer’
        
2. Enter the following command:
        >java Server

3. Open a new console window, navigate to the same directory path and enter the 
following command:
        >java Client blue

4. Open a third console window, navigate to the same directory path and enter the 
following command:
        >java Client red
        
This will display two game windows showing the karts and racetrack. Each game window 
will control one kart. The gameplay instructions are the same as part 2 however the keys used 
for both windows will be the same set { ‘UP, ‘DOWN’, ‘LEFT’, ‘RIGHT’ } as the program 
was developed to be run on two workstations.
